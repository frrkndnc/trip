Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

difference_in_seconds: Calculates the duration of each trip in seconds using the TIMESTAMPDIFF function.

differences: Breaks down the duration into parts (seconds, minutes, hours) using the MOD function.

average_difference: Computes average and maximum durations for member, casual, and overall trips using conditional aggregation.

ride_counts: Counts the number of rides for each member_casual category.

Main Query:

Selects information about individual trips along with calculated values for ride length, average ride length, and maximum ride length.

The CONCAT function is used to format the ride length values into a more human-readable format in terms of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

The DAYNAME function is used to get the day of the week for the trip's start and end times.

The main query also includes a CROSS JOIN to combine data from the ride_counts and summary_stats CTEs, creating a summary table.

Results and Output:

The final output includes summary information for each category (member, casual, and total) along with detailed information for individual trips.

The summary information includes ride counts, total rides, average ride length, and maximum ride length for each category.

Formatting:

The results are formatted to provide information in a more readable form, breaking down ride lengths into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Conclusion:

The code is designed to provide detailed and summary statistics for trips, distinguishing between member and casual rides.

Calculation of Ride Durations:

The code calculates the duration of each trip in seconds by subtracting the started_at timestamp from the ended_at timestamp.
It breaks down the duration into parts such as seconds, minutes, and hours.
Statistical Analysis:

The code then calculates various statistics for both member and casual rides, including average and maximum ride durations.
These statistics are computed separately for member and casual rides.
Day and Time Analysis:

The code extracts the day of the week (both for the start and end times) and categorizes each trip as either a weekday or weekend ride.
Presentation of Results:

The final result set includes detailed information for each ride, such as start and end times, rideable type, start station name, day of the week, and ride duration.
Additionally, it provides average and maximum ride durations for both member and casual rides.
Most Common Start Station:

The query also includes information on the most common start station name and its count, providing insights into the popular starting points for rides.
Grouping and Filtering:

The data is grouped by member type, rideable type, start station name, day of the week, and other relevant parameters.
Filtering is applied to include only member and casual rides.

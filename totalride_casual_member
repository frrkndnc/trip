--The ride_durations Common Table Expression (CTE) is created by selecting relevant columns from the trip.combined_data table. It extracts the day of the week, user type (member_casual), rideable type, and the duration of each ride in seconds.

--The main query then selects information from the ride_durations CTE and calculates the following statistics grouped by member_casual:

    total_rides: Count of total rides.
    total_ride_length: Total duration of rides formatted as days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
    avg_ride_length: Average duration of rides formatted similarly.

--The results are grouped by the member_casual column.

--The time-related calculations are done by converting the duration from seconds to days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

--This query provides insights into the total number of rides, total ride duration, and average ride duration for each user type (member or casual). It's a useful way to analyze and compare the ride patterns of different user segments.
